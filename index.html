      <h2>Samsung</h2>
      <p>
        Samsung's mobile cell business began with a car phone in 1984, while its
        first handheld mobile phone called the SH-100 was made in 1988. It
        expanded to other markets during the 1990s. Its first smartphone was the
        Samsung SPH-i300 in 2001. During the early 2000s Samsung popularised the
        clamshell ("flip phone") design, and the SGH-T100 was the first ever
        "true color" mobile phone and the firm's first to sell over 10 million
        handsets. In the mid-2000s the SGH-D500 popularised the slider form
        factor,and later slider products such as the E250 were hits.In 2006
        Samsung's X820 with a depth of 6.9 mm was the thinnest phone, and for
        many years its successor U100 would remain the skinniest at just 5.9 mm.
        In 2007 it launched the slate style touchscreen phone F700 which would
        precede its increasingly relevant touch phones such as Tocco and Omnia.
        Samsung overtook declining Motorola to become the world's second largest
        mobile phone marker during 2007.
